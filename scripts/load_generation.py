"""Load generator for the Meridian National Customer Service Concierge.

Sends a configurable number of conversations through the agent (either the
local compiled graph or a deployed LangSmith assistant) so LangSmith Engine
has enough variety to cluster issues.

Usage:

    # against the local in-process graph
    uv run python scripts/load_generation.py --mode local --n 150

    # against a deployed LangSmith assistant
    uv run python scripts/load_generation.py --mode remote --n 150 \
