"""Create / refresh the golden LangSmith dataset for the concierge.

Run once before running the offline experiment:

    uv run python evals/golden_dataset.py
    uv run python evals/golden_dataset.py --reset   # delete and recreate

The dataset contains exactly 7 examples, one per intent class. Each
example stores the expected reference answer plus the expected sequence
of tool names so the trajectory judge can grade against it.
